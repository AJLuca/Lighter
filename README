I.   What is Lighter?

Lighter is a kmer-based error correction method for whole genome sequencing data.
Unlike other methods, Lighter use sampling instead of counting to obtain a set of kmers
that are likely from the genome. Using this information, Lighter can correct the reads
containing sequence errors.

II. Install

Run "make" in the working directory.

III.  Usage
Usage: ./lighter [OPTIONS]
OPTIONS:
Required parameters:
	-r seq_file: seq_file is the path to the sequence file. Can use multiple -r to specifiy multiple sequence files
	-k kmer_length genome_size alpha
Other parameters:
	-od: output_file_directory (default: ./)
	-t: number of threads to use (default: 1)
	-trim: allow trimming (default: false)
	-discard: discard unfixable reads (default: false)
	-maxcor: the maximum number of correction for a read (default: 10)

NOTICE: genome_size does not be accurate, but it should be at least as large as the size of the sequenced genome.
        alpha is decided by the user. A rule of thumb: alpha=(3.5/C), where C is the coverage of the data set.

IV. Example

Suppose the data sets' coverage is about 70x:

Single-end data set:
./lighter -r read.fq -k 17 5000000 0.05 -t 10

Paired-end data set:
./lighter -r left.fq -r right.fq -k 17 5000000 0.05 -t 10
